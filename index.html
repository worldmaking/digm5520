<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> <em>This practice-based course develops computationally literate art practices addressing 3D spaces of mixed reality as creative media, applying the interactive malleability of computation to understand, create and imagine new kinds of artistic, responsive, and generative worlds.</em> That is, it addresses the spatialization of interactive computation, such that every part of <em>peripersonal</em> space around participants, in physical and virtual worlds, is rife with responsive behaviour. </p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Aesthetic computation in 3D mixed reality is a knowledge area of increasing importance in the domain of Digital Media. We are moving into an age in which daily immersion within computation is increasingly spatialized, surrounded by ever-denser interactive arrays of sensors, displays, and networked computational devices. </p>
<p>Some say that end-user technology is about to pivot toward augmented visual experiences incorporated with our audio-visual and somatic experience to create a transparent natural human integration with technology that will become a disruptive and enabling transformation for society on par with the personal computer revolution of the 1980s and the Internet revolution of the 1990s. A diversity of industries are also already investing heavily in each of these areas, yet acknowledge the necessity of new creative technologies, techniques, genres, and aesthetic practices to carry this work forward into the next generation of information technology. </p>
<p>The environments that surround us have a profound influence on shaping human potentials for access and interaction with the world we inhabit, with the virtual information spaces, and with each other. Immersive art is not new, but what differentiates computational immersive media from pre-digital immersive arts is the degree to which it is malleable, interactive, and affordable, allowing the immersion of a massive quantity of human perception and action within flexible, dynamic, and emergent systems.</p>
<p>The goal of the course is to engage with computationally literate art practices that apply the dynamic and interactive malleability of computation to deepen the aesthetic responsiveness of media environments surrounding us. The aim to understand, explore, and pioneer such developments from their arts and science foundations, in both theory and practice. </p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>Class hours are three per week, split between lectures and lab work. Lectures focus on the introduction of theoretical, aesthetic, contextual, and conceptual content of the course. Labs focus on practice in the form of instructor-led reconstructions, exercises/studies, and larger projects, and will include time for one-on-one/group meetings. </p>
<p>The course is hands-on, to learn about mixed reality world-making in a participatory. <!--Software systems and environments will be provided and developed together. Harware used may include RGBD cameras (e.g. Kinect), stereoscopic projections, VR head-mounted displays, and loudspeaker arrays. -->  With pandemic conditions in 2021, the course will be held entirely remotely. This poses an interesting challenge but also an opportunity to focus upon telematic multi-user mixed reality. We will be using web-based technologies (WebXR, WebAudio, etc.) to collectively improvise worlds.</p>
<!-- Theoretical and technical instruction enables students to develop projects, however the course is conceived as arts-focused and portfolio-centric, with emphasis primarily toward "compositional" and artistic explorations of 3D reality as a generative and responsive medium of expression (whether by producing artworks, or producing systems for creating art).--> We will critically engage with world makers ranging from the pre-digital immersive arts and early pioneers in artificial realities, to contemporary research-creation collaborations. 
<!-- such as the [Living Architecture Systems Group](http://livingarchitecturesystems.com) and [Artificial Nature](https://artificialnature.net). -->

<p>The course is understood to be an experimental undertaking whose success very much depends on everybody&#39;s collective enthusiasm and active engagement. It collaboration, diligence, curiosity, open-ness, and immediacy of creative thinking.</p>
<p><strong>For undergraduates:</strong> Prerequisite of EECS2030, DATT2050, or equivalent. This course complements existing engineering-focused courses such as EECS 4471 with an advanced practice-based focus blending art and technology.</p>
<p><strong>For graduate students</strong>: This course complements existing engineering-focused courses such as GS/CSE 6335 Topics in Virtual Reality, GS/CSE 6329 Advanced Human-Computer Interaction and GS/CSE 5323 Computer Vision, with a technologically advanced practice-based creative focus. Within DMG it is complemented by DMG 5200 Experimental Telepresence, DMG 5510 3.0 Physical Computing III, and DMG 5950 3.0 Artificial Life, Generative Art and Creative Code.</p>

</ul>
<p>Graduate students are expected to achieve a higher calibre of work and depth of research underlying the realization of the assignments and project. </p>
<p><strong>Assignments.</strong> Exercises are distributed through the course schedule to ensure iterative development of techniques needed to realize final projects, practice-informed critique, and experiential learning. Assignments are assessed by the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Execution: How well instructions were followed and conceptual goals of the assignment were met.</li>
<li>Aesthetic qualities: The clear and consistent articulation and composition of a creative whole, and the experiential and/or conceptual depth thereof, within the frame of the given assignment and context of the course.</li>
<li>Technical completeness: Functionality, accuracy, efficiency, creativity, and clear structure in the development and in the results.</li>
<li>Novel contribution: Ingenuity in response to unanticipated challenges, comprehension and creativity beyond what is demonstrated in labs, and vision in further extension. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Seminars.</strong> Students take turns to present on readings from landmark papers or book excerpts chosen to directly support the development of practical work and tutorial discussion. Students are examined for their awareness/understanding and creative extrapolation of issues in readings, and the ability to relate tutorial issues to the broader concerns of the projects, course, and broader field(s).</p>
<p><strong>Participation</strong> (Undergraduate students only). Incorporates presence, contributions to seminar discussions, engagement with the material, and effort and advancement in practical work. </p>
<p><strong>Final project.</strong> Realized individually or in groups, final projects demonstrate the effective application of understanding through the course in artistic explorations of 3D reality as a generative and responsive medium of expression; novel expressions of adaptive media and art, whether by producing artworks, or producing systems for creating art. Projects are evaluated in the same terms as the assignments outlined above. </p>
<p><strong>Final Presentations</strong> will be given to the class at the end of the semester and will be in the form of an open exhibit and talk, with critical discussion that reflects on the results of the experience gained over duration of the course.</p>
<p><strong>Final Report.</strong> (Graduate students only) will provide a final report that provides a documentation of the development of the project, overview of the concepts and motivation of the work, assessment of related works, and a description of future work to be done on this project.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes--objectives">Learning outcomes / objectives</h2>
<p>At the completion of the course students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show good understanding of the historical context and contemporary issues of generative art, spatial computing, responsive environments, and mixed reality</li>
<li>Demonstrate experiential grounding in multiple methodologies blending mathematical, theoretical, and/or aesthetic aspects</li>
<li>Be able to apply these methodologies effectively in creative practice to interactive 3D systems as evidenced in a portfolio of assignments/projects in emerging mixed reality technologies</li>
<li>Be able to articulate implementations and reflect critically within a variety of 3D interactive art areas, and leverage experience in the application of creative coding in interactive 3D spatial &amp; computational arts in order to intelligently extrapolate into future technologies</li>
