## What is Mixed Reality?

Mixed reality (MR) is the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist in real time. It describes a rapidly evolving spectrum of technologies and techniques merging real and virtual spaces, including spatial sensing and embodied interaction, spatial and heterogeneous visual and audio display. Incraesingly, the term is also taken to mean that these objects can also interact with each other.

> **The reality-virtuality continuum**. *Milgram, Paul; H. Takemura; A. Utsumi; F. Kishino (1994). "Augmented Reality: A class of displays on the reality-virtuality continuum" (pdf). Proceedings of Telemanipulator and Telepresence Technologies. pp. 2351–34. Retrieved 2007-03-15.*

- **Virtual reality (VR)** immerses users in a fully artificial virtual environment.
- **Augmented Virtuality**: some elements of the physical world are visualized within the predominantly virtual world, with spatial *registration* such that visualized objects remain constitent with real/virtual-world positioning. 
- **Augmented reality (AR)**: predominantly real world experience in which virtual objects are *overlaid* on the real-world environment, also with spatial registration such that virtual objects remain constitent with real-world positioning. Some kinds of overlays:
	- Virtual objects overlaid on a camera-based image, such as in a hand-held smartphone or tablet. E.g. Pokemon Go.
	- Virtual objects overlaid on a direct visual image (e.g. via AR glasses such as the Hololens).
	- Projection-mapping virtual images onto physical objects
- **Physical reality**, without technological mediation. 

**Observations**: These are predominantly *visual* definitions. What are the equivalents for our other senses? Note how essential *spatiality* is to mixed reality.

## What is Generative Art? 

*...and Generative Music, Generative Architecture, etc...*

> Generative Art refers to any art practice where the artist uses a system, such as a set of natural language rules a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is then set into motion with some degree of autonomy to or resulting in a complex work of art (Philip Galanter).

> "Generative art is a term given to work which stems from concentrating on the processes involved in producing an artwork, usually (although not strictly) automated by the use of a machine or computer, or by using mathematic or pragmatic instructions to define the rules by which such artworks are executed." Adrian Ward, 1999, on the eu-gene mailing list welcome page.

> "In essence, all generative art focuses on the process by which an artwork is made and this is required to have a degree of autonomy and independence from the artist who defines it." [McCormack, Jon, Oliver Bown, Alan Dorin, Jonathan McCabe, Gordon Monro, and Mitchell Whitelaw. "Ten questions concerning generative computer art." Leonardo 47, no. 2 (2014): 135-141.](http://jonmccormack.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/TenQuestionsV3.pdf)

> See [more definitions here](http://www.generative.net/read/definitions)

**Q:** How do you make art outside your own control?

**Autonomous systems** used in generative art have included:

- sets of rules or procedures: algorithms and games
- geometries and symmetries
- abstract mathematical or logical models
- mechanics and kinetics
- materials behaviors (such as fluid flow or chemical reactions)
- relationships and navigations in huge data-sets
- randomization, probability, statistics
- interactions between, and interpretations by, multiple agents

**Not just with computers.** Although "Generative Art" is often used to refer to computer-generated artwork that is algorithmically determined, the definition makes no reference of computers, and arguably generative artworks have existed throughout human history. Composers used strict rule systems (the counterpoint of Bach, the serialism of Schoenberg) as well as chance (the dice-game of Mozart and chance operations of Cage). Pointilism, cubism, and other abstractions in painting are rule-based constraints. Many art theorists refer to Sol LeWitt's textual instructions, to be carried out by others; a direction also explored in alternative scores in music. One might also mention kinetic sculpture and generative texts (particularly the Oulipo group), or the pattern-based arts of Islamic tiling and weaving, Celtic knots, and other traditional arts.

**Is all art generative?** The term generative is usually used for art in which these systems play a major role in the work, with significant autonomy from the artist's urges. **Q:** Is procedural content generation generative art?


**Computational technology revolutionized generative art.** The computer brings new ideas and possibilities that were previously been impossible or impractical to realise -- making it *qualitatively* different. Notably, a great deal of the earliest computer art was also generative. **Q:** Is generative art is one of the most essential forms of computational art? **Q:** What are the most singular features of computational media -- that is, what differentiates it from most other media?


### Complexity 

[Galanter, Philip. "What is generative art? Complexity theory as a context for art theory." In In GA2003–6th Generative Art Conference. 2003.](http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/ga2003_what_is_genart.pdf) Galanter locates generative art in terms of scientificy complexity theory, placing it at the peak of complexity in the order/disorder spectrum, where information processing is maximised, and both entropy and compressibility are minimized. This is comparable to the peak in physical complexity between orderly and chaotic matter, where the organizations of living systems are found.

### 10 Questions

McCormack et al. addressed the field by proposing 10 questions for its future. [McCormack, Jon, Oliver Bown, Alan Dorin, Jonathan McCabe, Gordon Monro, and Mitchell Whitelaw. "Ten questions concerning generative computer art." Leonardo 47, no. 2 (2014): 135-141.](http://jonmccormack.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/TenQuestionsV3.pdf)

- Can a machine originate anything? *Related to machine intelligence - can a machine generate something new, meaningful, surprising and of value: a poem, an artwork, a useful idea, a solution to a long-standing problem?*
- What is it like to be a computer that makes art? *If a computer could originate art, what would it be like from the computer's perspective?*
- Can human aesthetics be formalised?
- What new kinds of art does the computer enable? *Many generative artworks do not involve digital computers, but what does generative computer art bring that is new?*
- In what sense is generative art representational, and what is it representing?
- What is the role of randomness in generative art? *For example, what does the use of randomness say about the place of intentionality in the making of art?*
- What can computational generative art tell us about creativity? *How could generative art give rise to artefacts and ideas that are new, surprising and valuable?*
- What characterises good generative art? How can we form a more critical understanding of generative art?
- What can we learn about art from generative art? *For example, can the art world be considered a complex generative system involving many processes outside the direct control of artists, who are agents of production within a stratified global art market.*
- What future developments would force us to rethink our answers?


Four main components of a generative art system [Dorin, Alan, Jonathan McCabe, Jon McCormack, Gordon Monro, and Mitchell Whitelaw. "A framework for understanding generative art." Digital Creativity 23, no. 3-4 (2012): 239-259.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263596638_A_framework_for_understanding_generative_art)

- Entities
	The subjects on which the artwork's processes act; real or conceptual, simulated, physical, chemical, biological or mechanical.
	Generally unitary/indivisible, though they have properties and states, and may form hierarchies
	E.g. agent-based systems (whether monoculture or ecosystemic)
	Perceived only via a mapping

- Processes
	May or may not be directly apparent
	Operate on/by entities, possibly in process hierarchies
	Describe via:
	Initial conditions/initialization procedures
	Possibly termination conditions
	Continuation methods
	Micro/macro events
	Positive & negative feedbacks (cybernetics/regulation)
	Statistical macrobehaviours/system dynamic tendencies

- Environmental interaction
	Flows of information between artwork/system and its operating environment
	In both process of creation and final presentation (if separate)
	Initial or continual, discrete or continuous, parametric
	Physical sensors, human interaction, network...
	Interactions in terms of frequency, range, and significance
	How system output may influence subsequent input, also in frequency, range, and significance
	Tweaking, selecting, filtering, rewriting

- Sensory outcomes
	visual, sonic, musical, literary, sculptural, etc.
	static: snapshots, accretions, end-states
	time-based: offline, real-time, interactive
	multiplicity of results, framing/editing
	flat: entities/processes are directly visible
	mapping: transformation into perceptible outcomes, what should be perceived and how it should be mapped
	natural mappings closely align in structure / entities & process match ontology of outcomes -- but not always possible

**Q**: What is missing from this framework?

#### "Generative art must do more than simply implement formal systems imported from the sciences."

From Dorin et al., "A framework for understanding generative art", 2012.

Generative Art invokes questions of *distributed and non-human creativity.* However, the degree of autonomy in one artwork or another can vary considerably -- along with differing perspectives on the value of an artwork as object, versus its understanding embedded in a social/cultural activity.

## Artificial Nature

(Slideshow)

[Project website](https://artificialnature.net)


## Tools & architectures

Through the 10 years of Artificial Nature we have used Processing, Max/MSP/Jitter, Lua, JavaScript, GLSL, C++, OpenFrameworks, Cinder, Unreal Engine, WebGL, and SDKs including Kinect, OpenNI, OpenVR, Oculus, SteamVR, and many many more ... None of them were perfect, every time we are exploring new possibilities. Why?

1. General desire of **liveness**/live-coding: the ability to tweak parameters, replace parts of the system, and even rewrite its algorithms, while it is running. This is because complex systems are hard to predict, and action needs to be taken in context, and inpsipration acted on before the moment is lost.

2. General architecture of MVC (Model, View, Controller), i.e. **separating concerns** of interaction, simulation, and rendering. These systems can get big, and separating into parts helps. 

3. Driver support comes & goes. (Windows has better support than Mac/Linux). SDKs are constantly being updated (e.g. VR). Hardware comes & goes (e.g. many artists are using Kinects, which are no longer even manufactured). We will too. Expect bumpiness. 

4. **Performance** is critical, as we are dealing with real-time, high frame-rates, high resolutions, complex data simulations. Expect to have to rewrite simulations for performance; expect to think about what the CPU and GPU like most. Expect C++ and GLSL etc.

5. Agile development. Make it work, make it right, make it fast. Start with sketches, proofs-of-concept, integrate later. Test early, test often. Work in teams, with sprints and feature-branch workflows. Refactor to reduce, and comment more than code. 

As a result of all this, we'll have to do some software development as we go to create the platform we need. This is research!

We will use [Max](https://cycling74.com) as our entry point, as it has natural liveness, and good general support for many kinds of MR devices, and is fairly easy to extend where we need to. And we probably will need to go beyond Max in developing some parts (using languages including C++, GLSL, and JS). 


## Week 1 Tasks

1. Please ensure you have the latest version of [Max](https://cycling74.com) installed. If you do not already have a license, you can install the demo first, and [sign up here for Max license via Digital Media](https://forms.gle/RymSWGBbBAbnGeFb7)

- Follow the tutorials by [Federico Foreiro here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HORv7Ljd2gQ&list=PLRc5WfOZXC4lTij-h2bRQC4x6mDDkehKw&index=1) to get familiar (or refamilizarize yourself) with building 3D scenes in Jitter's OpenGL objects. If you haven't worked with Jitter GL before, do tutorials 1-3. If you have, do tutorials 5-7. 

2. Please read these papers and formulate your thoughts and questions for next week. Two volunteers are needed to lead focused discussions on them.
