# Spatial Computing in Responsive Environments

*Also known as "Generative Art in Mixed Reality" (both titles are used in York U course catalogs)*

**Synopsis:** This practice-based course develops computationally literate art practices addressing 3D spaces of mixed reality as creative media, applying the interactive malleability of computation to understand, create and imagine new kinds of artistic, responsive, and generative worlds. That is, it addresses the spatialization of interactive computation, such that every part of peripersonal space around participants, in physical and virtual worlds, is rife with responsive behaviour.

[Zoom meeting](https://yorku.zoom.us/j/94516869391?pwd=cWEyN0JIUFAvYU9xdmVmUXBhdXlxdz09), Tuesdays, 1pm, beginning September 14.
